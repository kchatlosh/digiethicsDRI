## “Public” data

Some questions to consider:  

> In an age of digital media, do we really have any privacy? ([Susan Barnes, “A Privacy Paradox,” 2006](http://firstmonday.org/article/view/1394/1312))  

* How do we delineate between "research" vs. "spying"?  Does this change when the project focuses on "big data"? (see [Berendt, Büchler, & Rockwell, “Is it Research or is it Spying? Thinking-Through Ethics in Big Data AI and Other Knowledge Sciences,” 2015](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~bettina.berendt/Papers/berendt_buechler_rockwell_KUIN_2015.pdf))  
* What forms of "public" data are ethical to use? Or require attribution?  
* How might we (inadvertently) share data?

## The question of personhood

Some questions to consider:  

> * Is an avatar a person?  
> * Is one’s digital information [e.g. photos, videos, audio, social media posts] an extension of the self?   
> * Can we assume a person is wholly removed from large data pools?" *Note: "there is considerable evidence that even ‘anonymised’
datasets that contain enough personal information can result in individuals being identifiable"*   
> * Does the connection between one’s online data and [their] physical person enable psychological, economic, or physical, harm? (AoIR)

## Activity 2: Think, Pair, Share  

Think about the digital project or research you are or will be working on. 

* Does your project collect data from human subjects? Or digital information that may be an extension of the self?
* Do you plan to conduct informed consent with such human subjects?  
* Would it be harmful if others could access this data? If yes, do you have a plan in place to anonymize and/or further protect the data, including on cloud and other data storage platforms? Are the benefits worth the risk - for who, respectively?   

Pair up with another person near you and discuss. Share as a class.
